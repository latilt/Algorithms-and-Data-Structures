# Data Structure
## What do they to
Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data
## Why so many
Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.
## Why care
The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures.
You've already worked with many of them unknowingly.
